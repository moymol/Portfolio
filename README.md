# Portfolio
A set of scripts, functions and classes related with statistical learning, ML, DL and dataviz developed by me a.k.a. Moyocoyani Molina-Esp√≠ritu.

This functions are open source and available for anyone. The main idea for this repositories is two folded.
1. This portfolio helps ME with the implementation and development of machine learning and deep learning models; with mathematical and statistical analysis; and visualizations for exploration or storytelling.
2. This portfolio helps YOU with the implementation and development of machine learning and deep learning models; with mathematical and statistical analysis; and visualizations for exploration or storytelling.

If you want to contribute with code reviewing, suggestions, corrections, or comments, I will be very glad. So, please, welcome n_n
